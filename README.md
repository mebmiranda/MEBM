### About Me ###

I am an aspiring Data Scientist and a Master of Science Student at Georgia Institute of Technology. 

My undergraduate degree is BS Industrial Engineering which I took from Adamson University. Then, I took MS Engineering Management at George Washington University. I also have several professional certifications such as Management Essentials from Harvard Business School, Lean Six Sigma Black Belt from Dartmouth College, Lean Six Sigma Green Belt from the University of Michigan, Certified Systems Engineering Professional from Internation Council of Systems Engineering, and Certified Associate in Project Management from PMI.

My current job role is leading business and IT-related projects such as system migration, internal audit, and process improvement.

Also, I am currently studying MS Analytics at Georgia Institute of Technology and planning to launch my data science career soon. I am excited to see how my strong leadership and management skills + the newly developed data science skills will help my future organization achieve its goals.
